Programmerings projekt

This is a project that five guys from Copenhagen Buisness school is trying to play around with. 
To have easy access anywhere and at any given time we decided to use github. 
This also enables us to write on our project and synch it so we all can write at the same time.

Thank you for reading this and showing interest in our project.

Kind regards,
